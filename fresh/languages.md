This is a rough estimate of my familiarity with various programming languages. 

The measurements are of Lines of Code for personal projects published on GitHub.

| Lang      | Lines | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| C++ | 17499 |
| C | 15845 |
| Assembly | 4222 |
| OCaml | 1601 |
| Scheme | 1377 |
| Haskell | 730 |
| Shell | 604 |
| Racket | 498 |
| Ruby | 416 |
| Rust | 338 |
| Perl | 216 |
| Clojure | 214 |
| ------------- | ------------- |

<br>
Some of the languages I am merely learning and have an inflated count due to the number of comments in the code i.e. Haskell, Assembly.

Some languages are very similar so individual counts may be misleadingly low i.e. Scheme, Racket, Clojure.

Some languages I know rather well but don't bother publishing a lot of code for i.e. Ruby, Python, Perl.
