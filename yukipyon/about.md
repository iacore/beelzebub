I am a Software Engineer at Qualcomm Technologies International (formally Cambridge Silicon Radio). My work is in the development of the company's core intellectual property. This primarily consists of maintaining and extending firmware for Qualcomm's range of Dual Mode Bluetooth chips. During my time at CSR/Qualcomm I have also been involved with a number of additional duties such as maintaining customer facing C++ applications, Expect style test scripts, testing infrastructure and introducing general tooling to increase team productivity.  

I have a keen interest in systems programming, peeking behind the proverbial curtain and generally digging down into the details of how things work. Although I am a trained Software Engineer I enjoy taking things apart as much as I enjoy putting them together in the first place.

I am indisposed to the custom of defining oneself by preferred choice of programming language. I predominantly love C and C++ but I also like [all kinds]({{ site.baseurl }}/stats/languages) of programming languages and paradigms.

The primary components to my arsenal of innovation are Vim and Tmux. These two independent tools together create a flexible and consistent development environment providing me with superior levels of productivity while working with any programming language, operating system or platform.

I am a Linux enthusiat. I mostly run Gentoo and Debian at home. I am under no illusians as to the shortcommings of Linux both technologially and sociologically; I just havn't found anything that suits my seems better yet.

Perhaps due to aspects of my childhood I have a keen interest in security, or as I like to think of it, the art of getting people to leave me the fuck alone. (I activly persue several security oriented activities in my free time such as reverse engineering, maintaining several Unix based systems, source code auditing and testing of open source projects.)

Editor: Vim.
I tried Emacs first but I felt that the model nature of Vim suited my way of thinking more.

Language: C++.
I like the vastness and complexity of the language. 

Operating System: Gentoo Linux.
Gentoo is all about building a system to your own specifications and allows you to avoid being vicimised by tradoffs based on the wants and needs of other users. Gentoo also provides ample opportunity to peek behind the metaphorical curtain and learn many things about how open source projects are packaged, configured, compiled and ultimatly deployed on a system.


I love Gentoo because it is a source based distribution. This gives me a much more intimate insight into how the operating system is constructed and how many different open source projects and configured and compiled. There is greater transparency and opportunity to fix problems when they arise and it is very easy to tinker and modify any software to be installed on the system. The thing I like most about Gentoo is the Hardened subproject. A major shortcomming of most other distributions in that the usability vs security tradeoff is made for you based on other people's needs. Since the user is essentially responable for building their own system this means the level of security of be adjusted as needed.

I am a second dan in the traditional style of Shotokan Karate and represented England as part of the KUGB National Squad for 3 years during my teen years. I still train though not at a competitive level.

I am a big fan of Japan and Japanese culture.
