I am a Software Engineer at Qualcomm Technologies International (formally Cambridge Silicon Radio) in Cambridge, UK. My work is in the development of the company's core intellectual property. This primarily consists of maintaining and extending firmware for Qualcomm's range of Dual Mode Bluetooth chips. 

I have a keen interest in systems programming, peeking behind the proverbial curtain and generally digging down into the details of how things work. I studied Software Engineering at Durham University but I enjoy taking things apart just as much as putting them together in the first place.

I am indisposed to the custom of defining oneself by a particular programming language or platform. I predominantly love C and C++ but I also like [all kinds]({{ site.baseurl }}/stats/languages) of programming languages and paradigms.

The primary components to my arsenal of innovation are Vim and Tmux. These two independent tools together create a flexible and consistent development environment providing me with superior levels of productivity while working with any programming language, operating system or platform.

I'm still at that very early point of my career where I have written more code at home than at work. Some of it I release as open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/yukipyon). Note: Since Qualcomm's takeover of CSR (13 Aug 2015) I have been advised to cease all open source activity.

Networking and maintaining a dozen physical and virtual Linux and BSD machines at home is a source of endless fun for me. My favourite Linux distribution is Gentoo, mostly for the educational value. 

I read a lot of [books]({{ site.baseurl }}/stats/books). When I get bored of books I read [research papers]({{ site.baseurl }}/stats/papers).

I am a 2nd dan in the traditional style of Shotokan Karate. I started when I was 9, graded to 1st dan at 13 and 2nd dan at 15. Age restrictions prevented me from grading further. <br><br>I represented England as part of the KUGB National Squad during my teen years. Some of my competition highlights are Silver for Under 16 Boy's Kumite at the KUGB National Championships 2008 and Silver for Under 16 Boy's Kata and Kumite at the KUGB Northern Region Championships 2006 and 2007. <br>I still train and teach at my local club in Cambridge, though not at a competitive level.

I am a big fan of Japan and Japanese culture and I am currently learning Japanese. I study for one hour each day over lunch. I know some basic to intermediate grammar and retain a vocabulary of over 300 words. At the moment this might be enough to hold a conversatin with a native 7 year old... <u><span title="Translation: but still a long way to go" style="background: lightgray;"> でも未だ先の話です...</span></u>

I also watch a lot of [anime]({{ site.baseurl }}/stats/anime).
