Staying Anonymous on a strange WiFi network can be harder than it first appears. Of course, you have taken the usual precautions such as spoofing your MAC address with a tool like [macchanger](https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger). However did you ever consider what your DHCP client may be leaking on the Application Layer? This post is about two ways that the [dhcpcd](https://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/index) client will betray your anonymity to the users of a Local Area Network if left in its default configuration.

Thread Model
===
When I take my laptop to McDonalds and use their free WiFi and then walk down the street to Costa (that's our European Starbucks), then I don't want those two network operators to uniquely identify my laptop in both their network logs and compare notes. Additionally if I return to the same network 1 month later I do not want the network operator to be capable of associating my activity last month with my activity this month. These two concerns are important to different people for different reasons and even if they are not concerns for you as a reader I hope they at least put this post into context.

DHCP Background
===
In this post we will be analysing DHCP messages from packet captures so it is important to have a basic overview of how DHCP works. DHCP is specified by [RFC 2131](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131) and uses a client/server architecture. On a wireless network, there is usually a single DHCP server which typically runs on the same hardware as the WiFi `Access Point`. The DHCP client (`dhcpcd` or `dhclient`) runs on the machine who wants to connect to the network.

DHCP is built on top of the `Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)` and uses `UDP` as its transport protocol. DHCP messages from a client to a server are sent to the 'DHCP server' port (67), and DHCP messages from a server to a client are sent to the 'DHCP client' port (68).

To start the DHCP process, the client will broadcast a `DHCPDISCOVER` message to UDP port 67. The DHCP server will respond with a `DHCPOFFER` message on UDP port 68, which will include an IP address. The client will respond with a `DHCPREQUEST`, using the IP address from the previous `DHCPOFFER` message and finally the server sends back a `DHCPACK`.

To save time on future connections to the same network, the DHCP client will skip straight to the `DHCPREQUEST` step, asking for the same IP address it had last time.

Kernel Version Leak
===
First off let's use a network packet capture tool to observe `dhcpcd` in action. If you use `dhcpcd` as your regular DHCP client then running it manually with the `-k` switch will relinquish the current IP address and stop the `dhcpcd` daemon. This will cause `dhcpcd` the next time it starts up to go through the whole `DHCPDISCOVER` --> `DHCPOFFER` --> `DHCPREQUEST` --> `DHCPACK` process from the beginning and let us capture a full DHCP session.

    † dhcpcd -k
    † tcpdump -i any -XX -s0 -n src portrange 67-68 and udp | tee dhcpcd.capture
    † dhcpcd

Where:

* `-i any` to capture on all network interfaces
* `-XX` to show captured packet contents and Ethernet header in both hex and ASCII
* `-s0` to capture whole messages and not truncate after a certain size
* `-n` to not resolve IP addresses into hostnames
* `src portrange 67-68 and udp` to only capture traffic on UDP ports 67 and 68

This is what the `DHCPDISCOVER` message looks like:

    12:58:58.946920 IP 0.0.0.0.68 > 255.255.255.255.67: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:05:66:7a:79:4e, length 353

You will probably notice an interesting string near the bottom of the message: `dhcpcd-6.11.3:Linux-4.4.8-hardened-r1:x86_64:GenuineIntel`. That is a lot of unnecessary and very specific information about our system that `dhcpcd` is sending without anyone telling it to. Even without the version numbers, there cannot be more than a handful of Hardened Gentoo users in any given geographic region. A network operator who looks through their logs will be able to single out all traffic belonging to a `dhcpcd` user across multiple browsing dates with reasonable certainty based on this alone.

This feature is called `Vendor class identifier` and is described in [RFC 2132](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132):

    9.13. Vendor class identifier

       This option is used by DHCP clients to optionally identify the vendor
       type and configuration of a DHCP client.  The information is a string
       of n octets, interpreted by servers.  Vendors may choose to define
       specific vendor class identifiers to convey particular configuration
       or other identification information about a client.  For example, the
       identifier may encode the client's hardware configuration.

The `dhcpcd` man page advertises a `-i` switch to change the information sent in this field:

     -i, --vendorclassid vendorclassid
             Override the DHCPv4 vendorclassid field sent.  The default
             is dhcpcd-<version>:<os>:<machine>:<platform>.  For example
                   dhcpcd-5.5.6:NetBSD-6.99.5:i386:i386
             If not set then none is sent.  Some badly configured DHCP
             servers reject unknown vendorclassids.  To work around it,
             try and impersonate Windows by using the MSFT vendorclassid.

Although it is tempting to impersonate a more commonly used DHCP client, (for example Windows using `-i "MSFT 5.0"`), be aware of other differences between the clients. For example Windows might send different `Option` fields to `dhcpcd` by default, or send the same ones in a different order. Things like that may still be used to uniquely identify a machine in a log file or packet capture. Additionally, differences in the Windows and Linux TCP/IP stack can be used by an active adversary to fingerprint a device [link](https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html) if one's threat model extends that far.

Real MAC Address Leak
===
A more concerning feature of dhcpcd is that the first time it runs (ever), it will cache the MAC address of the wireless card and use it in all future connections. Lets use Wireshark to verify this:

    † tshark -i wlp1s0 -V -j udp -f "portrange 67-68"

Where:

* `-i wlp1s0` is the network interface to capture on
* `-V` to print a view of the packet details
* `-j udp` to only capture UDP packets
* `-f "portrange 67-68"` to only capture packets on ports 67 and 68

This is what the `DHCPDISCOVER` message looks like:

    Frame 1: 395 bytes on wire (3160 bits), 395 bytes captured (3160 bits) on interface 0 Interface id: 0 (wlp1s0)
    (...)
    User Datagram Protocol, Src Port: 68, Dst Port: 67
        Source Port: 68

    (...)
    Bootstrap Protocol (Discover)

    (...)
    Option: (61) Client identifier
        Length: 19
        IAID: 3d472283
        DUID Type: link-layer address plus time (1)
        Hardware type: Ethernet (1)
        Time: 535985390
        Link layer address: 00:05:66:7a:79:4e
    (...)

Notice how the `Client MAC address` field and `Link layer address` are completely different. Let's try to disconnect from the network, run `macchanger`, reconnect and rerun `dhcpcd`; will it send the same `Link layer address`?

    † ifconfig wlp1s0
    wlp1s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500

Yes, dhcpcd keeps sending the original MAC address even though we have used `macchanger`. This breaks both scenarios in our threat model. Someone with access to logs of network A and network B can trivially track our activity on both networks with a high level of certainty. Additionally, repeated visits to the same network can all by linked together in the same way. This is despite connecting to each network, on each occasion, with a different MAC address.

What is happening is that the first time it runs, `dhdcpd` will cache the MAC address in a file called `/etc/dhcpcd.duid` and resend it on every `DHCP` request, on every network one tries to connect to. Using a Live System will help, but only as long as the `/etc/dhcpcd.duid` file does not initially exist. If you roll your own live system image you may find yourself with exactly the same problem if the image is generated from a device which has used dhcpcd at any time in the past.

Funnily enough it is difficult to track down any mention of this `DUID` thing in the RFCs. It appears to have been introduced in [RFC 3310](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315#section-9) and is specifically for IPv6:

    Each DHCP client and server has a DUID.  DHCP servers use DUIDs to
    identify clients for the selection of configuration parameters and in
    the association of IAs with clients.  DHCP clients use DUIDs to
    identify a server in messages where a server needs to be identified.
    See sections 22.2 and 22.3 for the representation of a DUID in a DHCP
    message.

    (...)

    The DUID is carried in an option because it may be variable length
    and because it is not required in all DHCP messages.  The DUID is
    designed to be unique across all DHCP clients and servers, and stable
    for any specific client or server - that is, the DUID used by a
    client or server SHOULD NOT change over time if at all possible; for
    example, a device's DUID should not change as a result of a change in
    the device's network hardware.

So tracking a client between sessions is literally the point of this feature. It appears to be only relevant for IPv6 but `dhcpcd` will send it even in IPv4 only mode (the `-4` switch). Additionally, the DHCP servers I am testing against do not seem to mention this `DUID` in their responses and may not even be using it.

Deleting `/etc/dhcpcd.duid` will force dhcpcd to regenerate it with the current MAC address.

But if either of these issues bother you I would recommend using a different DHCP client instead of relying on workarounds.
