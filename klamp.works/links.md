Podcasts
---

[Risky Business](http://risky.biz/netcasts/risky-business) - A weekly Information Security podcast. Very professional, informative and entertaining.
<!--<strike><a href="http://securityweekly.com/podcast/psw.xml">Security Weekly</a></strike>\- I've stopped listening to this. The interview sections are usually good but that still leaves you with ~40 minutes of complete and utter garbage per episode. Probably not worth your time.-->

[Developer Tea](http://feeds.feedburner.com/developertea) - Mostly meta and language agnostic and therefor good. However, the host does have a tendency to shoot off into irritating tangents on trivial things like web development and answering "where do I start" type questions.

[cognicast](http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast) - A podcast mostly about Clojure. The format is one topic per episode and the episodes can drag on for a while so cherry picking episodes based on title and description is advised.

[Functional Geekery](http://www.functionalgeekery.com/) - General functional programming podcast. The host does a good job of finding interesting guests.

[BSD Now](http://www.bsdnow.tv/) - Is sometimes bogged down with Linux bashing and ZFS worship but mostly interesting.

[Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/) - It's worth going through the archives to find interesting episodes.

[Programming Throwdown](http://www.programmingthrowdown.com/) - Very light weight and general but amusing.
